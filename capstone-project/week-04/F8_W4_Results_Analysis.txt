STRATEGY VALIDATION
================================================================================

Week 3 Strategy: ADAPTIVE MODEL SELECTION → GP
  
Models Tested:
  1. Linear SVM:         70.0% CV
  2. Decision Tree:      83.3% CV ⭐ WINNER
  3. Random Forest:      75.0% CV
  4. Logistic Regression: 72.0% CV
  5. Medium NN:          78.0% CV

Selected Model: Decision Tree
  Margin over 2nd place (NN): +5.3%
  
Sequential Pipeline:
  Decision Tree (83.3% CV) → GP Expected Improvement
  
Candidate Filtering:
  - 70% from high-confidence "good" predictions
  - 30% from boundary regions (exploration)
  - Total candidates evaluated: 11,234
  
Final Selection:
  Source: Decision Tree-APPROVED
  Model Confidence: 87.5%
  GP Prediction: 9.45 ± 0.23
  Expected Improvement: HIGHEST among all candidates

================================================================================
KEY INSIGHTS - WHY IT WORKED
================================================================================

✓ ADAPTIVE SELECTION ADVANTAGE:
  Decision Tree's 83.3% CV (vs SVM 70%) meant better candidate filtering
  13.3% improvement in classification = fewer false negatives
  
✓ NON-LINEAR CAPABILITY:
  Decision Tree captured dimension interactions linear models missed
  Feature importance: X5 (0.45), X8 (0.32) - key dimensions identified
  
✓ BOUNDARY STRATEGY:
  30% allocation to uncertain regions ensured exploration
  Prevented over-exploitation of known good areas
  
✓ GP UNCERTAINTY BONUS:
  High σ at submission point boosted Expected Improvement
  Balanced exploitation (high μ) with exploration (high σ)

================================================================================
DIMENSION ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Submission Point Characteristics:

Boundary Dimensions (at bounds):
  X1 = 0.012 (near 0)
  X3 = 0.002 (near 0)
  X7 = 0.153 (low)

Active Dimensions (mid-range):
  X2 = 0.366
  X4 = 0.165
  X5 = 0.448 ⭐ (high importance)
  X6 = 0.535
  X8 = 0.745 ⭐ (high importance)

Pattern:
  - Boundary strategy on X1, X3, X7 (low values)
  - Exploration in X5, X8 (high DT importance dimensions)
  - This matches Decision Tree's learned decision boundary

================================================================================
COMPARISON TO BASELINE
================================================================================

If we had used Linear SVM (70% CV) instead:
  - More false negatives (good points rejected)
  - Worse candidate pool quality
  - Likely would NOT have found this point
  
Adaptive selection impact:
  +13.3% CV improvement (70% → 83.3%)
  = Better filtering
  = Found rank #1 point
  
🎯 STRATEGY VALIDATED: Adaptive model selection WORKED!

HISTORICAL PROGRESSION
================================================================================

Week 1: Random exploration
  Value: ~5.50 (estimated)
  Rank: ~40/43

Week 2: Initial GP optimization  
  Value: ~8.20 (estimated)
  Rank: ~20/43
  
Week 3: Adaptive Model Selection → GP
  Value: 9.818813
  Rank: #1/43 🏆
  
Improvement: +78.5% from Week 1 to Week 3

================================================================================
WEEK 5 STRATEGY RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

OPTION 1: EXPLOIT THE WIN (Conservative)
  - Submitted point is RANK #1
  - Search locally around [0.012, 0.366, 0.002, 0.165, 0.448, 0.535, 0.153, 0.745]
  - Small perturbations in X5, X8 (high importance dims)
  - Goal: Incremental improvement from 9.82 → 9.85+

OPTION 2: CONTINUE ADAPTIVE STRATEGY (Balanced)
  - Re-run model comparison with 43 samples (not 42)
  - Decision Tree likely still wins
  - Apply same 70/30 strategy
  - Let GP find next highest EI point

OPTION 3: EXPLORE NEW REGION (Aggressive)
  - Current best found via boundary strategy (X1, X3, X7 near 0)
  - Test opposite boundary (X1, X3, X7 near 1)
  - Risk: May find worse region
  - Reward: Could discover alternative optimum

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED: OPTION 2 (Continue Adaptive)
================================================================================

Rationale:
  ✓ Strategy already proved successful (rank #1)
  ✓ One more sample won't change model selection much
  ✓ GP will naturally bias toward local exploitation (current best)
  ✓ 30% boundary allocation maintains exploration
  ✓ Data-driven approach (not assumption-based)

Expected Week 5 outcome:
  - Point near current best (X5, X8 similar)
  - Value: 9.75 - 9.90 range
  - Rank: #1 or #2
